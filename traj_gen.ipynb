    "As GDAS files are in 3 hour intervals, the very last trajectories in January\n",
    "and August will not generate properly without the third group of weeks.\n",
    "As a general principle, meteorology data sets corresponding to the desired time\n",
    "and geospatial extent must be available to successfully generate trajectories.\n",
    "These data sets must be in the ARL-packed format.  All meteorology downloaded\n",
    "through the HYSPLIT ARL data FTP is already in this format, and HYSPLIT\n",
    "contains some utilities to convert other file types to this format. \n",

    "Prior to attempting trajectory generation with PySPLIT, the user should ensure\n",
    "that meteorology file names follow a format of '*mon*YY*#' or '*mon*YYYY*#' where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* '*' is a Bash-style wildcard\n",
    "* 'mon' is a three-letter lower-case abbreviation of the month\n",
    "* 'YY' or 'YYYY' is a two or four digit integer representation of the year \n",
    "* '#' is the number of the file within the month\n",

    "'edas.jan2007_2'.\n",
    "\n",
    "This naming convention is required because PySPLIT examines file names to\n",
    "determine which meteorology files correspond to the desired date of\n",
    "trajectory launch.  It is strongly recommended that users keep meteorology\n",
    "files of different types/origins, like the two files in the example above,\n",
