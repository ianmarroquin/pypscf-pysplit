# pypscf-pypsplit

The pysplit package (https://github.com/mscross/pysplit/tree/master/pysplit) is required to use the following python notebook files. To create the trajectory files, use generate_trajectory.ipynb and then cluster_trajectory.ipynb to cluster the resulting trajectories. However, it may be easier to generate the back trajectory files using pyPSCF instead.
